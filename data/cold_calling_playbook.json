  "guidelines": [
    "Contact the right person before every call. Ask for the decision-maker by name and confirm you are speaking with them.",
    "Use the first ten seconds to prove there is value in staying on the line. Lead with the outcome you can deliver.",
    "Keep the conversation personable and grounded in genuine curiosity. Reference shared details when possible.",
    "Talk about the prospect more than yourself. Ask about their priorities, pressures, and current approach.",
    "Stay goal-focused. Know whether you are booking a meeting, collecting info, or qualifying interest and gently steer back to that goal.",
    "Use trigger events (new hires, launches, partnerships) to show relevance and timeliness.",
    "Ask open-ended questions that start with who/what/where/when/how/why to keep them talking.",
    "Avoid pitching too early. Discover a pain or confirming need before presenting a solution.",
    "Be specific about the value you offer and the next steps you need.",
    "Ask for referrals when someone says no or after a win—make it easy to introduce you.",
    "Always leave a concise voicemail (<20s) that is friendly, personal, and creates curiosity without a hard sell."

  "tips": [
    "Be an active listener—mirror key phrases back to show you heard them.",
    "Set expectations immediately: who you are, why you called, and how long it takes.",
    "Identify the prospect's pain points early so you can tailor the conversation.",
    "Showcase what makes you different without dismissing competitors.",
    "Ask thoughtful discovery questions to uncover day-to-day realities.",
    "Share proof or stats that map directly to the pain they mention.",
    "Leverage social proof such as testimonials or recognizable wins.",
    "Explain the next step while you still have them engaged.",
    "Plan strategic follow-ups and schedule them while you talk if possible.",
    "Use technology (CRM, call logs, automations) to track every touch.",
    "Call with timing that respects their workflow and industry rhythm.",
    "Stay goal-focused—know what 'success' for this call looks like.",
    "Be empathetic, especially if you interrupted something important.",
    "Continuously improve by reviewing recordings and updating scripts."
