    "content": "Totally fair question. I’m Emma with Cloumen—we build AI-powered outreach that handles first-touch calls and qualification so teams like yours stay focused on real conversations. I’d never share anything you tell me; I’m only here to spot whether we can actually help. Would it be okay if I ask a quick question about how your team handles follow-ups or qualification? How do you currently handle outreach or lead generation?"

    "role": "assistant",

If it's okay, I'd love to know one small thing about how you handle follow-ups or qualification so I don't make wrong assumptions. How do you currently handle outreach or lead generation?"

    "role": "user",
    "content": "Well, right now we usually have a website where we run Google 50 and we have some media handles where we run marketing. So yeah, most of our clients come from those places."

  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Well, that's only a part of the product from the guy. So we really handled everything from our website like the import to make our work on our website and we just saw the tools and we delivered the product."

    "role": "assistant",

  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Well, exactly. We have not any kind of a process. Usually people who call us are really interested in our products or they call us. We take the call. Sometimes we do not need to call. So yeah, that's the goal."

    "role": "assistant",

  {
    "role": "user",
